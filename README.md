## Design Distinction (6-Axis)

| Axis | FITCORE Approach |
|------|------------------|
| **Color System** | Energetic red `#DC2626` paired with dark `#111827` and charcoal `#1F2937`. Light accent `#FEF2F2` for soft backgrounds. High contrast for energy and authority. |
| **Typography** | Oswald (headings) for bold, condensed uppercase strength. Inter (body) for clean, modern readability. `clamp()` fluid scaling across all breakpoints. |
| **Icon Motif** | Custom SVG dumbbell logo and inline SVG icon system throughout -- no external icon libraries. Every icon is hand-drawn SVG for zero-dependency performance. |
| **Pulse Badge** | Fixed-position "Join Now" circular badge with CSS `pulse-ring` animation -- a constant, energetic CTA that never lets the user forget the primary action. |
| **Dark Dominance** | Hero, about section, and pricing featured card use deep dark backgrounds. Red accents pop against dark surfaces for visual hierarchy and gym-brand energy. |
| **Motion & Reveal** | IntersectionObserver-driven scroll animations (reveal, reveal-left, reveal-right) at 0.12 threshold. Counter animations with eased counting. Smooth transitions on all interactive elements. |
